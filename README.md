# Blackjack
General rules of the game:
1. It is a 2-player game: a user/player and a computer dealer.
2. 1 standard deck of cards (52 cards) is used.
3. The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over (busting).
4. Card values: 2–10 are face value, Jack/Queen/King are worth 10, Ace is worth 1 or 11.
5. The player can choose to "Hit" (take a card) or "Stand" (end their turn).
6. The dealer reveals their hand after the player stands and must hit until at least 17.
7. If either player goes over 21, that player loses the round.
8. Optional house rule: if the player holds 5 cards without busting, the player wins the round.

The Game features:
- when a player gets over 21 points, that round is over immediately.
- the game should keep a score for the players winning each round. The scores will be 
visible in the interface.
- After each round, it would ask the user if wants to continue or not.

The Coding/Design Requirement:
- You must follow and implement the Object-oriented paradigm (different classes, 
methods calling each other, objects passing etc.)
- Avoid repetition of code; (for example, winning condition is same for both players; you 
should not write the same code twice for each player)
- You must also apply Exception Handling in appropriate places.
- In your demonstration, you should also show the UML diagram and explain the 
relationships among the different classes you have created for this project.
